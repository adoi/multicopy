# multicopy

Multicopy is a VS Code extension that lets you copy and paste multiple snippets of code in your workspace. 

I made this extension because I needed a feature like this on VS Code and I didn't find something similar :)

## Features

1. Copy multiple snippets of code and add them to the stack
2. Paste the saved snippets of code where needed in your workspace
3. Delete all snippets from the stack (when you don't need them anymore)


## How to use

![multicopygif](/media/gifmulticopy.gif)

1. To copy a snippet you press `cmd+shift+c` (on Mac) or `ctrl+shift+c` (on Windows) 
2. To paste a snippet from the list of snippets you press `.` and you get the list of snippets
3. To delete all snippets, if you don't need them anymore, you press `alt+m`.


## Known Issues

There could be a better (more intuitive) command for deleting all the snippets if you don't need them anymore.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0
